What happens when you promise to monitor a file that does not exist?

What happens when a file you promise to monitor appears?

``` {.bash org-language="sh" results="output" exports="both" wrap="example"}
exec 2>&1

touch /tmp/watch_for_change-noupdate-0.txt

What happens when a file you are monitoring for change changes stats?

``` {.bash org-language="sh" results="output" exports="both" wrap="example"}
exec 2>&1
chmod 666 /tmp/watch_for_change-detect_all_change-0.txt
chmod 666 /tmp/watch_for_change-noupdate-0.txt
cf-agent --no-lock --log-level inform --file ./example_body_changes.cf
:
```

In this output, notice that the same messages are emitted about
`/tmp/watch_for_change-noupdate-0.txt`{.verbatim} multiple times, this
is because the promise to monitor that file for change is configured to
**not** update the changes database, thus the agent keeps re-noticing
that file has been altered since it\'s information was first stored.

``` example

What happens when you change a files content?
