Do something once, and *never again*.

CFEngine is not designed to facilitate this sort of pattern. It\'s quite
doable, but not very succinct.

  notice: Q: ".../bin/echo 'Neve": Never more, quoth the raven
    info: Last 1 quoted lines were generated by promiser '/bin/echo 'Never more, quoth the raven''

# Thoughts on something more dynamic

Leverage metadata (classes/variables)matching to find the kind of
signal. But the value is date based.

Hit button on app for one time power off. App makes api call to
Enterprise Hub, setting the host specific var power~offDATESTAMP~, e.g.
power~off20210917010101~\".
