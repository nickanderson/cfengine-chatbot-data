#+TITLE: Can cfengine promise a file is owned by one user or another?
CLOSED: [2018-11-21 Wed 18:07]

Well, owners in perms bodies do take lists, I wonder if that can be used for
this use case.

https://docs.cfengine.com/docs/3.12/reference-promise-types-files.html#owners

List of acceptable owners or user ids, first is change target

The first user is the reference value that CFEngine will set the file to if none
of the list items matches the true state of the file. The reserved word none may
be used to match files that are not owned by a registered user.

#+BEGIN_SRC cfengine3
  bundle agent main
  {
    vars:

      "mode" string => "warn";

      "script_executed_from_cron" string => "/tmp/example.sh";

      # A list of users that we are OK with owning the file. Basically, this would
      # be the user whos crontab we are investigating
      "candidates" slist => {
                              "USERNAME",
                            };

    files:
      "$(script_executed_from_cron)"
        perms => root_or_preffered_owner_only_writeable( @(candidates) ),
        action => warn_or_fix( $(mode) );

  }
  body perms root_or_preffered_owner_only_writeable( acceptable_owners )
  {
      owners => { "root", @(acceptable_owners) }; # if the file isnt owned by root
                                                  # or one of the users listed in
                                                  # acceptable_owners, then it
                                                  # will be reset to the first
                                                  # listed user ('root')

      mode => "u+w,g-w,o-w"; # user writeable, group and other not writeable
  }
  body action warn_or_fix( mode )
  {
      action_policy => "$(mode)";
  }
