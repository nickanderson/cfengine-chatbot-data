#+title: Example illustrating body action action_policy

#+begin_src cfengine3 :tangle body_action_action_policy.cf
  bundle agent __main__
  {
    files:
        "/tmp/file-action-default"
          content => "Hello world from /tmp/file-action-default";

        "/tmp/file-action-warn"
          create => "true",
          content => "Hello world from /tmp/file-action-warn",
          action => policy( "warn" );
  }

  body action policy( action_policy )
  {
        action_policy => "$(action_policy)";
  }
#+end_src

What happens when you run the policy?

#+CAPTION:
#+begin_src sh :results output :exports both
  exec 2>&1
  cf-agent --no-lock --log-level inform --file ./body_action_action_policy.cf
  :
#+end_src

Notice the output indicates =/tmp/file-action-default= was created and =/tmp/file-action-warn= was not created (because of the action policy).

#+RESULTS:
:     info: Updated content of '/tmp/file-action-default' with content 'Hello world from /tmp/file-action-default'
:  warning: No action was requested for file '/tmp/file-action-default'. Maybe a typo in the policy?
:     info: files promise '/tmp/file-action-default' repaired
:  warning: Should create file '/tmp/file-action-warn', mode '0600', but only warning promised
:  warning: Warnings encountered when actuating files promise '/tmp/file-action-warn'
