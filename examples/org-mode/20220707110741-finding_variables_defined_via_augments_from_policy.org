#+title: Example illustrating Finding variables defined via Augments from policy
[[id:38277465-771a-4db4-983a-8dfd434b1aff][CFEngine Examples]]

#+begin_quote
How would I be able to list vars defined in augments in a policy?
#+end_quote

You could read in Augments yourself, and use ~getindices()~. But I think there are various reasons that I would send this to the bottom of my list. I think it would be better to search based on metadata like the ~source=augments_file~ tag.

Consider this example =def.json=.

  {
      "variables":
      {
          "MyVar": {
              "value": "MyVal"
          },
          "MyBundle.MyVars": {
              "value": [ "My", "Vals" ]
          },
          "MyNamespace:YourBundle.MyData": {
              "value": {
                  "has": "more",
                  "stuff": [ "deep", "inside" ]
              }
          }
      },
      "vars":
      {
          "MyVar": "MyVal",
          "MyVars": [ "My", "Vals" ],
          "MyData": {
              "has": "more",
              "stuff": [ "deep", "inside" ]
          }
      }
  }
#+end_src

  bundle agent __main__
  {
     vars:
      "variablesmatching" slist => variablesmatching( ".*", "source=augments_file" );
      "variablesmatching_as_data" data => variablesmatching_as_data( ".*", "source=augments_file" );


    reports:
      'variablesmatching( ".*", "source=augments_file" ) found $(variablesmatching)';
      'variablesmatching_as_data( ".*", "source=augments_file" ) found $(with)'
        with => storejson( variablesmatching_as_data );
  }
#+end_src

Running the policy:

#+begin_src sh :results output :exports both
  exec 2>&1
  chmod 600 /tmp/6001/vars-from-augments.cf
  cf-agent -Kf /tmp/6001/vars-from-augments.cf
  :
#+end_src

Execution Output:

#+RESULTS:
#+begin_example
R: variablesmatching( ".*", "source=augments_file" ) found default:def.MyData
R: variablesmatching( ".*", "source=augments_file" ) found default:def.MyVars
R: variablesmatching( ".*", "source=augments_file" ) found default:MyBundle.MyVars
R: variablesmatching( ".*", "source=augments_file" ) found default:def.MyVar
R: variablesmatching( ".*", "source=augments_file" ) found MyNamespace:YourBundle.MyData
R: variablesmatching_as_data( ".*", "source=augments_file" ) found {
  "MyNamespace:YourBundle.MyData": {
    "has": "more",
    "stuff": [
      "deep",
      "inside"
    ]
  },
  "default:MyBundle.MyVars": [
    "My",
    "Vals"
  ],
  "default:def.MyData": {
    "has": "more",
    "stuff": [
      "deep",
      "inside"
    ]
  },
  "default:def.MyVar": "MyVal",
  "default:def.MyVars": [
    "My",
    "Vals"
  ]
}
#+end_example

Note: The example shows the use of the /variables/ key which was added in 3.18.0 along with other Augments extensions like =host_specific.json=.
