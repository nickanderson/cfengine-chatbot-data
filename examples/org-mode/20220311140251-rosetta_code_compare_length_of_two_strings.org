#+title: Example illustrating Rosetta Code: Compare length of two strings

https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Compare_length_of_two_strings

Given two strings of different length, determine which string is longer or shorter. Print both strings and their length, one on each line. Print the longer one first.

Measure the length of your string in terms of bytes or characters, as appropriate for your language. If your language doesn't have an operator for measuring the length of a string, note it.

Extra credit

Given more than two strings:
list = ["abcd","123456789","abcdef","1234567"]
Show the strings in descending length order. 

#+begin_src cfengine3 :include-stdlib t :log-level info :exports both :tangle rosetta_code_compare_length_of_two_strings.cf 
  bundle agent __main__
  {
    vars:
        "strings" slist => { "abcd", "123456789", "abcdef", "1234567" };
  
        "sorted[$(with)]"
          string => "$(strings)",
          with => string_length( "$(strings)" );
  
        "sort_idx" slist => reverse( sort( getindices( "sorted" ), lex ) );
  
    reports:
        "'$(sorted[$(sort_idx)])' is $(sort_idx) characters in length.";
  }
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: R: '123456789' is 9 characters in length.
: R: '1234567' is 7 characters in length.
: R: 'abcdef' is 6 characters in length.
: R: 'abcd' is 4 characters in length.
