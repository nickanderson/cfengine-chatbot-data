I was able to search for a multi-line string using =regcmp()= and =readfile()=.

It would probably be a nice addition to have a function that could do grep natively and return boolean to define a class. For this case at least then you wouldn't need to keep the entire file content stored in a variable.

We have a grep function, but it operates on lists and not files. http://docs.cfengine.com/docs/master/reference-functions-grep.html
