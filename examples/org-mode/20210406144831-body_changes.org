What happens when you promise to monitor a file that does not exist?

#+CAPTION: 
#+begin_src sh :results output :exports both
  exec 2>&1
  cf-agent --no-lock --log-level inform --file ./example_body_changes.cf
  :
#+end_src

What happens when a file you promise to monitor appears?

#+begin_src sh :results output :exports both :wrap example

  touch /tmp/watch_for_change-noupdate-0.txt

What happens when a file you are monitoring for change changes stats?

#+begin_src sh :results output :exports both :wrap example
  exec 2>&1
  chmod 666 /tmp/watch_for_change-detect_all_change-0.txt
  chmod 666 /tmp/watch_for_change-noupdate-0.txt

#+end_src

In this output, notice that the same messages are emitted about =/tmp/watch_for_change-noupdate-0.txt= multiple times, this is because the promise to monitor that file for change is configured to *not* update the changes database, thus the agent keeps re-noticing that file has been altered since it's information was first stored.
